  <span class="visually-hidden">"R</span> healthcare access"—when we hear these words, typically we think of how difficult it is for rural americans to get medical care. This is true in New York, too. In some of New York’s least populated areas, like the region west of the Adirondacks, there’s a shortage of doctors who take Medicaid—the low-cost healthcare plan that serves the states poorest residents.
<p>This region, which encompasses Cooperstown, Herkimer, and smaller towns around Utica, has one Medicaid doctor for every 121 low-income households. This reflects a broader doctor shortage in the region, which has one doctor (of any kind) for every 638 households (of any income.)
</p>
<p>But doctor access is not just a rural problem. Let’s compare two regions with similar proportions of low-income residents. In both the Bronx and Binghamton, NY, around 30% of residents make less than $25,000 per year.

  <div class="container">
    <p>In Binghamton, there is one Medicaid doctor for every 27 low income households. (Not far off from the state average of 26.)  This town of 47,969 is served by three hospitals, a children’s hospital, and a free community clinic run by Upstate Medical University. The population is 78% white and is served by 353 doctors. 92% of them bill Medicaid.</p>
    <p>In the Bronx, there is one Medicaid doctor for every 54 low income households. </p>
    <p>One difference is scale: there are 172,707 households in the Bronx which make make less than $25,000 a year, despite a high cost of living. This group comprises about a third of the total population. About a dozen Bronx hospitals serve 1.47 million people. The population is mostly Black and Latino, and is served by 3,299 doctors, and most of them bill Medicaid.
    </p\
    <p>Bronx residents can and do seek care in places like Manhattan. But despite being home to some of New York’s largest public hospitals, only 75% of doctors on the island regularly accept Medicaid—the lowest rate of Medicaid billing in the state.</p>
